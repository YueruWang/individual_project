title: My undergraduate study
---
I got my bachelor's degree at Fudan University in June 2021. It has a beautiful campus and I love it a lot!

I majored in statistics as an undergraduate student. It's been a hard time learning it. But finally I get into the world of statistics and enhance my intelligence during the process.

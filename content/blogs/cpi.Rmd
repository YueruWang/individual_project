title: CPI and components change
---
In this project, we would like to find out how has the CPI and its components changed over the last few years.

We will use [CPI components at FRED](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843).

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```


```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
library(infer)
library(tidyquant)
library(rvest)
library(ggtext)
```

```{r, scrape_fred_cpi_data,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"


# We get the tables with CPI data that exist on FRED page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# Parse the HTML tables into a dataframe called `cpis` 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
cpis <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())

# The second table on the page contains the list of all CPI components
cpi_id <- cpis[[2]] %>% 
  select(series_id)

# Transform the dataframe into vector form
vectorcpi_id <- as.vector(t(cpi_id)) 
  
# Extract data from the FRED website 
cpi_data <- tidyquant::tq_get(vectorcpi_id, get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01") 

# Create a different dataframe that includes the observation titles called `cpi_names`
cpi_names <- cpis[[2]] 

# Merge the data and the titles dataframes
cpi_doc <- left_join(cpi_data, cpi_names,
                     by = c("symbol" = "series_id")) 

# Use the lag function to get the 12 month change in prices for each component ...
cpi_change <- cpi_doc %>%
  group_by(title) %>% 
  mutate(year_change = price/lag(price, 12, na.rm = TRUE) - 1,
            date) %>% 
  na.omit()

cpi_change

# ... and make sure that "All Items" appears first in the dataframe
# Additionally, we clean the titles
cpi_change <- cpi_change %>% 
  mutate(index = symbol == "CPIAUCSL") %>%
  mutate(title = str_remove_all(title, "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: ")) %>%
  mutate(title = str_remove_all(title, " in U.S. City Average"))

# Next, we order the components within each month based on their impact on the annual CPI change for that month and create a new dataframe
cpi_ordered <- cpi_change %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
  arrange(desc(index), date, desc(year_change))

cpi_ordered 

cpi_ordered2 <- cpi_ordered %>%
  group_by(title)%>%
  select(title) %>%
  distinct()
  
component_order = as.character(cpi_ordered2$title)
component_order

```

Next, we created the scatter plot of each component, where a negative change is shown in blue and a positive change in CPI is shown in red. We included the geom_smooth function to show the trend in CPI development

```{r, scrape_fred_cpi_data_graph, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 10, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
cpi_ordered %>% 
  filter(date >= "2016-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = year_change)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = year_change > 0)) +
  geom_smooth(colour = "dark grey", se=F) +
  facet_wrap(~fct_relevel(title,component_order), scales = "free") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(
       title="Yearly change of US CPI (All Items) and its components",
       subtitle="YoY change being <span style = 'color: red;'>positive</span> or <span style = 'color: blue;'>negative</span> \nJan 2016 to Aug 2021",
       y = "YoY % Change",
       x = "",
       caption = "Data from St. Louis Fed FRED \nhttps://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"
       ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_markdown(),
        plot.caption = element_text(color="black"),
        legend.position = "none")
   
```


```{r cpi_all_components_since_2016, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cpi_components_since_2016.png"), error = FALSE)
```

We use [relative importance of components in the Consumer Price Indexes: U.S. city average, December 2020](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm). 
Here we created a new scatter plot that includes only the most important components of the overall CPI change.
Since the FRED only supplies some of the major categories, we only include: All Items, Housing, Transportation, Food and Beverages, and Apparel.

```{r}

cpi_ordered$title_ordered = factor(cpi_ordered$title, levels=c("All Items", "Housing","Transportation","Food and Beverages","Apparel"))

cpi_ordered %>%
  filter(date >= "2016-01-01", title_ordered == c("All Items", "Housing","Transportation","Food and Beverages","Apparel")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = year_change)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = year_change > 0)) +
  geom_smooth(colour = "dark grey", se=F) +
  facet_wrap(~title_ordered, scales = "free") +
   scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(title="Yearly change of US CPI (All Items) and its most important components", 
       subtitle="YoY change being <span style = 'color: red;'>positive</span> or <span style = 'color: blue;'>negative</span> \nJan 2016 to Aug 2021",
       y = "YoY % Change",
       x = "",
       caption = "Data from St. Louis Fed FRED \nhttps://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"
       ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_markdown(),
        plot.caption = element_text(color="black"),
        legend.position = "none")

```

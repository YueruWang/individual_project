Since high school, I gradually deepened my interest in Kpop dance, street dance and choreography. I have learnt Hiphop, Jazz and Waacking during these years and loved each of them.

I enjoy the feeling of expressing yourself according to the music on the stage. I also tried to be a choreographer several times during my undergraduate studies. It's always been challenging when compose those movements, but it also can be very rewarding when you finally lead your whole team to win great applaud from the audience. 

I would say that street dance would be my life-long hobby and I will always keep promoting the charm of street dance to people surrounding. By the way, this picture is taken at LBS gym. It's so nice to meet someone sharing the same hobby with you and dance together!
